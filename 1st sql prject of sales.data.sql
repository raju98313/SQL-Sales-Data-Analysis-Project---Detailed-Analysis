##Optimize queries with indexes

-- 1 add index on customerid
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_customer_id ON sales(CustomerID);
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_info_customer_id ON customers_info(CustomerID);

-- 2 add index on invoice 
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_invoice_no ON sales(InvoiceNo);


-- 3 add index on invoicedate
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_invoice_date ON sales(InvoiceDate);

-- 4 add composite index on frequant joint + filter combo
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_customer_country ON sales(CustomerID, Country);

-- 5 add index on description
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_description ON sales(Description);

-- you can analyze query performance using
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM sales WHERE CustomerID = 17850;

-- This shows whether MySQL is using your index or doing a full table scan.
